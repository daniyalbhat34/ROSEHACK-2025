## Info:
This is all our second hackathon.

We chose to implement a simple fight game

## Game:
We have a player and a bunch of enemies attacking him. The player has the option to heal or to fight. The playes loses stamena as well as health when he receives damage from the enemy. If the player defeats all the enemies, he wins or else if he loses all his health, he loses the battle. The player also loses if he loses all his stamena. After healing, the player can gain some of his health but not the stamena.
